# Data Science Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level data science projects. Each project demonstrates different aspects of the data science workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, machine learning, and evaluation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **`EDA.ipynb`** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook demonstrating techniques for understanding datasets, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
* **`house prediction.ipynb`** – Machine learning model for predicting house prices based on features such as location, size, and amenities. Covers data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
* **`sentiment analysis.ipynb`** – Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that performs sentiment classification on textual data (positive, negative, neutral). Includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
